# THESE ARE THE PROJECT PARAMETERS NEEDED TO GENERATE THE REPORT

# When running the case on a local computer, modify this in case you saved the case in a different directory

# Please ENTER the name of the file with the data used. The file should contain a matrix with one row per observation (e.g. person) and one column per attribute. THE NAME OF THIS MATRIX NEEDS TO BE ProjectData (otherwise you will need to replace the name of the ProjectData variable below with whatever your variable name is, which you can see in your Workspace window after you load your file)

# Please ENTER the class (dependent) variable:
# Please use numbers, not column names! e.g. 82 uses the 82nd column are dependent variable.
# YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE DEPENDENT VARIABLES TAKES ONLY 2 VALUES: 0 and 1!!!

# Please ENTER the filename that indicates subsets of the data to use (e.g. only a specific cluster)
# This file need to have 2 columns with the second one indicating the cluster ID of the observation. 
# The rows of this files are aligned with those of the datafile_name one

# PLEASE ENTER THE Tree (CART) complexity control cp (e.g. 0.001 to 0.02, depending on the data)
